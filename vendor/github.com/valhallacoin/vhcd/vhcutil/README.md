Package vhcutil provides valhallacoin-specific convenience functions and types.
A comprehensive suite of tests is provided to ensure proper functionality.

This package was developed for vhcd, a full-node implementation of Valhalla which
is under active development by Company 0.  Although it was primarily written for
vhcd, this package has intentionally been designed so it can be used as a
standalone package for any projects needing the functionality provided.
